## 🎯 Questions You Might Get

### Q: "How accurate is the AI evaluation?"
**A:** "We use Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, which has been trained on billions of code samples. We also have multiple evaluation criteria - correctness, efficiency, readability - and weight them appropriately. The AI also includes a confidence score with each evaluation."

### Q: "What about cheating?"
**A:** "We have multiple safeguards: time limits, question randomization, and we're building in proctoring features like tab-switch detection. The AI also analyzes coding style consistency."

### Q: "How do you handle bias?"
**A:** "The AI actively checks for bias in evaluation. We also use blind screening - no names or photos during initial evaluation. The AI flags if certain demographics score differently on specific questions."

### Q: "Can it scale?"
**A:** "Absolutely. We use async processing with Celery, MongoDB for horizontal scaling, and Redis for caching. The architecture can handle thousands of concurrent users."

### Q: "What's the cost?"
**A:** "The main cost is the Gemini API, which is very affordable - about $0.01 per assessment. Everything else is open-source or has free tiers."

### Q: "How long does evaluation take?"
**A:** "30-60 seconds per candidate. It's async, so recruiters don't wait. They get notified when results are ready."

### Q: "What makes this different from existing ATS?"
**A:** "Three things: 1) Deep AI analysis, not just keyword matching, 2) Personalized feedback for ALL candidates, 3) Explainable AI that shows reasoning."
